# The KFIoU Loss for Rotated Object Detection

> Xue Yang

KFIoU + RoI Transformer

Differing from the well-developed horizontal object detection area whereby the computing-friendly IoU based loss is readily adopted and well fits with the detection metrics.

In this paper, we argue that one effective alternative is to devise an approximate loss who can achieve trend-level alignment with SKewIoU loss instead of the strict value-level identity.

Specifically, we model the objects as Gaussian distribution and adopt Kalman filter to inherently mimic the mechanism of SkewIoU by its definition, and show its alignment with the SkewIoU at trend-level.

The resulting new loss called KFIoU is easier to implement and works better compared with exact SkewIoU, thanks to its full differentiability and ability to handle the non-overlapping cases.

This paper aims to find an easy-to-implement and better-performing alternative. By calculating the error variance and comparing the final performance, we find the key to maintaining the consistency between metric and regression loss (including L1, KLD, GWD and KFIoU etc.) lies in the trend-level consistency between approximate and exact SkewIoU loss rather than value-level consistency.

Then we use a center point loss to narrow the distance between the center of the two Gaussian distributions, follow by calculating the overlap area under the new position through Kalman filter.

1) For rotation detection, instead of exactly computing the SkewIoU loss which is tedious and unfriendly to differentiable learning, we propose our new approximate loss - KFIoU loss. It follows the protocol of Gaussian modeling for objects, yet innovatively uses Kalman filter to mimic SkewIoU's computing mechanism.

2) Compared with plain SkewIoU loss, our KFIoU loss is easy-to-implement, and works better due to fully differentiable and able to handle the non-overlapping cases. Compared to Gaussian-based losses (GWD, KLD) that try to approximate SkewIoU by specifying a distance which requires extra hyperparameters tuning and metric selection, our mechanism level simulation to SkewIoU is more interpretable and natural, and free from hyperparameter tuning.

3) We show that KFIoU achieves a trend-level alignment with SkewIoU, where the trend deviation is measured by our devised error variance. While the error variance for GWD and KLD are much larger. The effectiveness of such a trend-level alignment strategy is verified by comparing KFIoU with ideal SkewIoU. On extensive benchmarks (aerial images, scene texts, face), our approach also outperforms other SOTA alternatives (GWD, KLD).

4) We further extend the Gaussian modeling and KFIoU loss from 2-D to 3-D rotation detection, with notable improvement compared with baselines. To our best knowledge, this is the first 3-D rotation detector based on Gaussian modeling which also verifies its effectiveness, which is in contrast to focusing on 2-D rotation detection.

与水平检测器的IoU Loss相比，旋转检测器通常涉及基于SkewIoU的更复杂的损失，这不利于基于梯度的训练

一种有效的替代方法是设计一个近似损失，该损失可以实现与SkewIoU损失的趋势水平对齐，而不是严格的值相等

具体方法为：将对象建模为高斯分布，并采用卡尔曼滤波器Kalman filter根据其定义固有地模拟SkewIoU的机制，并在趋势级别显示其与SkewIoU的对齐

和最近的基于高斯建模的旋转检测器（例如GWD、KLD）不同的是，GWD们涉及人为指定的分布距离度量，需要额外的超参数调整

由于其完全可区分性和处理非重叠情况的能力，与精确SkewIoU相比，产生的称为KFIoU的新损失更易于实现，并且工作得更好

然后上面的思路，可以或占到3D等情况

当前旋转大纵横比、密集分布的物体仍有挑战

大纵横比对象之间的Skew Intersection over Union(SKewIoU)分数对对象位置的偏差很敏感，导致了metric(SKewIoU)和回归损失之间的不一致的负面影响

- 纵横比：Aspect Ratio；角度偏差：Angle Deviation

- 当Angle Deviation固定，SkewIoU会随着Aspect Ratio增加而下降(Smooth L1 Loss不变)

- 当SKewIoU不变时，Smooth L1 Loss会随着Angle Deviation增加而增加

- sharply!!! 变化的很夸张哦

通过IoU Loss和相关的变量，GIoU，已经对水平检测中的metric和回归损失有一定的解决方案

在旋转检测中，由于旋转box之间的交叉复杂度计算困难，使得SKewIoU的计算过程的解决方案不容易得到

该论文旨在设计一个更容易实现、性能更好的替代品

- 通过计算误差方差和比较最终性能发现，保持metric和回归损失的一致性关键在于近似和精确SkewIoU Loss之间的趋势水平一致，而不是值的一致

- 不错不错，这就简化了方案设计难度了

- 设计一个基于Kalman filter的替代方案，命名为KFIoU Loss，可以轻易地通过深度学习框架和现有操作实现，不需要额外加速

- 具体方面是将rotate bounding box转换为高斯分布，则避免了边界不连续boundary discontinuity和类方形square-like问题

- 利用中心点损耗缩小两个高斯分布中心点之间的距离，通过Kalman filter计算新位置下的重叠面积
