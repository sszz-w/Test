# DOTA: A Large-scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images

Although the past decade has witnessed major advances in object detection in natural scenes, such successes have been slow to aerial imagery, not only because of the huge variation in the scale, orientation and shape of the object instances on the earth's surface, but also due to the scarcity of well-annotated datasets of objects in aerial scenes.

To build a baseline for object detection in Earth Vision, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on DOTA. Experiments demonstrate that DOTA well represents real Earth Vision applications and are quite challenging.

In contrast to conventional object detection datasets, where objects are generally oriented upward due to gravity, the object instances in aerial images often appear with arbitrary orientations, as illustrated in Fig. 1, depending on the perspective of the Earth Vision platforms.

- The scale variations of object instances in aerial images are huge. This is not only because of the spatial resolutions of sensors, but also due to the size variations inside the same object category.
- Many small object instances are crowded in aerial images, for example, the ships in a harbor and the vehicles in a parking lot, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Moreover, the frequencies of instances in aerial images are unbalanced, for example, som small-size images contain 1900 instances, while some large-size images may contain only a handfull of small instances.
- Objects in aerial images often appear in arbitrary orientations. There are also some instances with an extremely large aspect ratio, such as a bridge.

To our knowledge, DOTA is the largest annotated object dataset with a wide variety of categories in Earth Vision. It can be used to develop and evalute object detectors in aerial images. We will continue to update DOTA, to grow in size and scope and to reflect evolving real world conditions.

We also benchmark state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on DOTA, which  can be used as the baseline for future algorithm development.
