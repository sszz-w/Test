# DOTA: A Large-scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images

> Gui-Song Xia, CVPR 2018

Although the past decade has witnessed major advances in object detection in natural scenes, such successes have been slow to aerial imagery, not only because of the huge variation in the scale, orientation and shape of the object instances on the earth's surface, but also due to the scarcity of well-annotated datasets of objects in aerial scenes.

To build a baseline for object detection in Earth Vision, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on DOTA. Experiments demonstrate that DOTA well represents real Earth Vision applications and are quite challenging.

In contrast to conventional object detection datasets, where objects are generally oriented upward due to gravity, the object instances in aerial images often appear with arbitrary orientations, as illustrated in Fig. 1, depending on the perspective of the Earth Vision platforms.

- The scale variations of object instances in aerial images are huge. This is not only because of the spatial resolutions of sensors, but also due to the size variations inside the same object category.
- Many small object instances are crowded in aerial images, for example, the ships in a harbor and the vehicles in a parking lot, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Moreover, the frequencies of instances in aerial images are unbalanced, for example, som small-size images contain 1900 instances, while some large-size images may contain only a handfull of small instances.
- Objects in aerial images often appear in arbitrary orientations. There are also some instances with an extremely large aspect ratio, such as a bridge.

To our knowledge, DOTA is the largest annotated object dataset with a wide variety of categories in Earth Vision. It can be used to develop and evalute object detectors in aerial images. We will continue to update DOTA, to grow in size and scope and to reflect evolving real world conditions.

We also benchmark state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on DOTA, which  can be used as the baseline for future algorithm development.

DOTA: DOTA数据集的创始论文

地球表面物体实例的规模、方向和形状存在巨大差异。航空场景缺少标注良好的数据集

2806幅航空图像，4000×4000像素，15中常见对象类别，包含188282个实例，每个实例由任意四边形标记

航空图像中的物体实例以任意方向出现，是第一大问题

当前解决方法大多数是将自然场景开发的目标检测转移到航空图像领域；也有采用基于大规模的数据集（ImageNet和MSCOCO）上先与训练的微调网络的方法

但是：航空图像的目标检测任务在一些方面和传统的目标检测任务不同

- 对象实例变化大：传感器的分辨率不同；同一列别内的尺寸变化

- 小对象实例一般扎堆聚集，对象分布不均匀

- 对象实例以任意方向出现

- 存在纵横比非常大的现象：桥梁

数据集偏差问题：跨数据集的普遍化程度通常较低

数据集UCAS-AOD和NWPU VHR-10倾向于在理想条件下使用图像(清晰的背景和密集分布的实例)，无法反映问题的复杂性

该论文在DOTA数据集上对SOTA算法进行了基准测试baseline
