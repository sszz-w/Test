# SCRDet: Towards More Robust Detection for Small, Cluttered and Rotated Objects

> Xue Yang, ICCV2019

Object detection has been a building block in computer vision. Though considerable progress has been made, there still exist challenges for objects with small size, arbitrary direction, and dense distribution.

Apart from natural images, such issues are especially pronounced for aerial images of great importance. This paper presents a novel multi-category rotation detector for small, cluttered and rotated objects, namely SCRDet.

Specifically, a smapling fusion network is devised which fuses muti-layer feature with effective anchor sampling, to improve the sensitivity to small objects.

Meanwhile, the supervised pixel attention network and the channel attention network are jointly explored for small and cluttered object detection by suppressing the noise and highlighting the objects feature.

For more accurate rotation estimation, the IoU constant factor is added to the smooth L1 loss to address the boundary problem for the rotating bounding box.

However, most existing detectors do not pay particular attention to some useful aspects for robust object detection in open environment: small object, cluttered arrangement and arbitrary orientations.

In real-word problems, due to limitation of cammera resolution and other reasons, the objects of interest can be of very small e.g. for detection of traffic signs, tiny facts under public cameras on the streets.Also, the objects can range in a very dense fashion e.g. goods in shopping malls.

- Small Objects. Aerial images often contain small objects overwhelmed by complex surrouding scenes;
- Cluttered arrangement. Objects for detection are often densely arranged, such as vehicles and ships;
- Arbitrary orientations. Objects in aerial images can appear in various orientations. It is futher challenged by the large aspect ratio issue which is common in remote sensing.

In this paper, we mainly discuss our approach in the context of remote sensing, while the approach and the problems are general and we have tested with various datasets beyond aerial images as will be shown in the experiments.

Many existing general-purpose detectors such Faster-RCNN have been widely employed for aerial object detection. However, the desgin of such detectors are often based on the implicit assumption that the bounding boxes are basically in horizontal position, which is not the case for aerial images(and other detection tasks e.g. scene text detection).

This limitation is futher pronounced by the popular non-maximum suppression(NMS) technique as post-processing as it will suppress the detection of densely arranged objects in arbitrary orientation over the horizontal line.

Moreover, horizontal region based methods have a coarse resolution on orientation estimation, which is key information to extract for remote sensing.

We propose a novel multi-category rotation detector for small, cluttered and rotated objects, called SCRDet which is designated to address the following issues:

- Small Objects: a smapling fusion network (SF-Net) is devised that incorporates feature fusion and finer anchor sampling;

- Noisy background: a supervised multi-dimensional attention network (MAD-Net) is developed which consists of pixel attention network and channel attention network to suppress the noise and highlight foreground.

- Cluttered and dense objects in arbitrary orientation: an angle sensitive network is devised by introducing an angle related parameter for estimation.

Combing these three techniques as a whole, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets including two remote sensing benchmarks DOTA and NWPU VHR-10.

1. For small objects, a tailored feature fusion structure is devised by feature fusion and anchor sampling.
2. For cluttered, small object detection, a supervised multi-dimensional attention network is developed to reduce the adverse impact of background nosie.
3. Towards more robust handling of arbitrarily-rotated objects, an improved smooth L1 loss devised by adding the IoU constant factor, which is tailored to solve the boundary problem of the rotating bounding box regression.
4. Perhaps more importantly, in Section 4.2 we show that the proposed techniques are general, and can also be applied on natural images and combined with general detection algorithms, which surpass the state-of-the-art method or futher improves the existing methods by combination.
